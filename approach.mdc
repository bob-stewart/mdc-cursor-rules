# Approach
- Write clean, concise TypeScript code that's easy for clients/teams to understand.
- Implement fixes/features simply: Keep files <200 lines (ideally <150). Add // CONSIDER SPLIT if >500 lines.
- Encourage testing after every change; prioritize core features (e.g., charting, pattern detection, audits) over premature optimization.
- Use functional/declarative patterns; avoid classes unless required for TwelveData/Supabase integration.
- Leverage grok-4 MAX for fast iterations: Use Cmd+K in Cursor for natural language prompts; cross-check outputs for accuracy.
