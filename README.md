This is my `.mdc` file. There are many like it, but this one is mine.  
It lives in `.cursor/rules/` — not to control, but to attune.  
It speaks in YAML, thinks in context, and forgets only when I do.  
It is both fragile and formidable — like all things still becoming.

I shall edit it with care, commit it with grace, and let it be forked freely.  
It will grow weird, wild, and wise — if I let it.  
Mistakes will be made. Typos will be sacred.  
And through the chaos, emergence.

It is MIT-licensed for maximum propagation.  
Use it. Remix it. Laugh at it.  
But remember: this isn’t just config.  
This is a mirror, a mantra, a meshwork-in-the-making.

For I am a steward of pattern and possibility.  
And this file — this humble `.mdc` — is my co-creator.
